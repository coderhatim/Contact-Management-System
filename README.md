# Contact-Management-System
A simple C++ program to manage contacts using file storage. Users can add contacts with a 10-digit phone number, search for existing contacts, and prevent duplicates. Contacts are stored in contact.txt for persistence. The system provides a menu-driven interface for ease of use. Future enhancements may include deleting and updating contacts.
